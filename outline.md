```
0. Speed Driven. should be lots of clickable places, not just widgets
	(click top left to replenish, update, stop overflow etc... so its dynamic and engaging)
	shortcut keys
1. Try not to deviate away too much from main theme
2. Messages come in as you solve problems
3. Plot, you can't always be living in the 90s...COBOL assembler it (use all your cool packages..)
